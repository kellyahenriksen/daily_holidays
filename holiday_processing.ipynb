Fully mature pandas can be up to six feet long and reach 350 pounds. Pandas are technically carnivores due to their sharp teeth and digestive tracts, but their diets consist nearly exclusively of bamboo. (This is largely because they don’t have the energy to chase anything. Their prey would virtually have to land in their lap, be injured, or too slow to escape.) Pandas eat up to 85 pounds of bamboo a day and can scarf down a shoot in about 40 seconds. But all that fiber has side effects: An adult panda can produce more than 60 pounds of droppings in 24 hours! Eating and sleeping make up most of the panda's day, in fact one reason for pandas being rare is that breeding is not high on their list of priorities. And with only a one-day window a year for a female to conceive naturally, it is hardly surprising that pandas are an endangered species. Of course they are also endangered due to habitat destruction, and thankfully organizations like the WWF are working to keep them around for years to come!\",\n",

At age 16 he was kidnapped by Irish raiders and sold as a slave to a Celtic priest in Northern Ireland. After toiling for six years as a shepherd, he escaped back to Britain. He eventually returned to Ireland as a Christian missionary. Among the legends associated with St. Patrick is that he stood atop an Irish hillside and banished snakes from Ireland—prompting all serpents to slither away into the sea. In fact, research suggests snakes never occupied the Emerald Isle in the first place. There are no signs of snakes in the country’s fossil record.

In Havana, Cuba, in the 1930s, there was a genuine bartender who gained popularity with vacationers who went by the name of Sloppy Joe. He earned his name for his less than enthusiastic way of cleaning the bar.  He was, however, an attentive bartender, and the bar was a hot spot for the jet set. However, no mention is found in papers from the era of a hot sandwich on the menu matching the description of a Sloppy Joe, and the man of the same name retired to Spain in 1933. Town Hall Deli in Maplewood, NJ claims to have a direct connection to Sloppy Joe of Havana fame. It opened in 1927, and during the 1930s, Maplewood’s Mayor Sweeney traveled to Havana, where he met the bartender named Sloppy Joe and was served a delicious sandwich. The mayor came back to New Jersey and with a well-developed taste for Joe’s sandwich. The mayor enjoyed it so much he asked one of Town Hall Deli’s proprietors, Fred Heinz, to replicate it. According to the website, “It was made with coleslaw, ham, cow tongue, swiss cheese, with lots of dressing and was served on thin rye bread. Hence, the origin of the Sloppy Joe sandwich and how Town Hall Deli of South Orange became The Birthplace of the Sloppy Joe!” Then in 1934 at the Ye Olde Tavern Inn, in Sioux City, Iowa, Abraham and Bertha laid claim to the Sloppy Joe when they added a loose meat sandwich on their menu in 1934.

The origins of pasta alla carbonara are widely debated and there's no clear answer as to where it came from. Some theories state it is an Italian invention while others claim it is an American invention. An interesting theory is that it was invented in WWII when American GIs were stationed in Rome and their rations consisted of eggs and bacon, which was combined with regional pasta to create the dish. This is somewhat unlikely as many chefs will tell you carbonara cannot be made with powdered eggs, which is how the rations were given. Regardless of how it came to be, the general recipe we know today was first published in American and Italian cookbooks around the 1950s. The recipe usually consists of the same 4 ingredients but the proportions are widely debated. First is the pasta, usually spaghetti but it can be anything as long as it has a lot of surface area for sauce to cling to, so you generally want the long noodles. Second is the eggs, often with more yolks than whites to give it that extra rich texture (again, proportions vary widely from recipe to recipe). Next is the cheese, usually pecorino, parmesan, or some combination of these cheeses. Finally is the pancetta (pork belly) or guanciale (pork jowl), which is often substituted with bacon but many will tell you it's not really the same. Purists will also refute the use of cream in the recipe, reasoning that the egg, when prepared properly, should give all the creaminess necessary. No matter how you prepare it, this rich dish is sure to please - even The New York Times ranks it top of its list of the 20 most popular pasta recipes!\",\n",

The ingredients necessary for pizza dough — wheat flour, corn oil, salt, and yeast — were not among the rationed foods, and the filling could be made from leftover meats and vegetables. The deep-dish pie was also the perfect meal for manual laborers. Two entrepreneurs were quick to spot the appetite of the boys marching home. Ike Sewell, an ex-University of Texas lineman, and Ric Riccardo, a food business operator of Italian-American heritage, teamed up to open Pizzeria Uno. They sold the first deep-dish pie in 1943. It had a thicker crust than a super-skinny Napoli pie, but not the super-thick crust of a Sicilian one, called Sfincione or Sfinciuni. Rather than being baked on the bottom of the oven, deep-dish was baked in a circular pan, two to three inches deep. The pizza was also upside-down. A thick layer of mozzarella cheese was topped with meat or vegetables, covered with tomato sauce, and topped with crust. The concoction required a knife, a fork, and a napkin — and it was cooked to order. This pizza spawned many other deep-dish pizza places in Chicago over the years, and has ignited much debate over its allure. From Anthony Bourdain to Graham Eliot to Mario Batali, chefs deride the Chicago invention, calling it at worst an abomination and at best unworthy of being called pizza. Foodie comedians have joined in on the oh-so-superior complaint festival. But in the Second City, deep-dish pies are beloved. Native Chicago-ans, like Ike Barinholtz and Shonda Rhimes, have come out swinging.

This early description gave the world the image of the horse-like body, the white color, and the single horn, an image that would later be transformed into the medieval unicorn. He actually had the Indian rhinoceros in mind (or perhaps someone\\'s description of it—Ctesias himself never visited India). The Indian rhinoceros and one other Far-Eastern species are the only land mammals with one horn. But the Indian rhinoceros has a massive, ungainly body, stumpy legs, and a thick, folded hide that looks like plates of armor. With the exception of its single horn, it is profoundly unlike the lithe unicorn of medieval art, and one can understand why Marco Polo wasn\\'t exactly dazzled when he first encountered one. The 13th century Italian explorer had finally gotten a glimpse of a \"unicorn\" and he was sorely disappointed. He wrote: ',\n",

       " 'Today\\'s notion of the grilled cheese is commonly traced back to the 1920s, when Otto Frederick Rohwedder, considered \"the father of sliced bread,\" invented a bread slicer that made distributing white bread easy and affordable. Shortly before that, processed cheese had been patented by James L. Kraft, an entrepreneur whose revolutionary pasteurizing process ensured that cheese wouldn\\'t spoil, even when transported long distances. By 1914, J.L. Kraft & Bros. Company (the precursor to Kraft Foods) opened its first plant in Illinois; five years later, the company had already expanded into Canada. Of course, this \"factory cheese\" — disparagingly termed \"rattrap cheese\" or \"rat cheese\" by the English who were fiercely proud of their cheddars — was not considered a delicacy. It was, simply, a cheap and scalable product. During World War II, Navy cooks prepared countless \"American cheese filling sandwiches\" — as instructed by government-issued cookbooks — in ships\\' kitchens. In the 1940s and \\'50s, these were usually served open-faced and consisted of one slice of bread topped with grated cheese. In 1949, Kraft Foods introduced Kraft Singles — individually wrapped slices of processed cheese — and supermarkets began stocking them in 1965. Also around that time, the second, perhaps most important, piece of bread was added on top, likely as a way to make the sandwich more filling, and the modern notion of a grilled cheese sandwich was born. It\\'s also worth noting that the actual term \"grilled cheese\" doesn’t make an appearance in print until the 1960s; before that it was always \"toasted cheese” or \"melted cheese\" sandwiches.

       " 'April 13th is the birthday of Alfred Butts, known as the inventor of Scrabble. In 1931, Butts wrote a paper entitled \"Study of Games.\" In his paper, he described three categories of games: board games, number games using playing cards or dice, and letter games (or games that fell into more than one). He noted that, although the most popular games were of the first two (e.g., chess and backgammon), the best letter game readily available was a game called Anagrams. Around that time, he was reading The Gold-Bug by Edgar Allan Poe and noticed a line containing the English letter distribution. This gave him an epiphany: Anagrams would be more fun if the most common letters in English were more common in the game. He carefully analyzed letter frequencies in newspapers such as The New York Times and other printed works to determine the ideal letter distribution for the game. With a few other changes, he named his project Lexiko. The name comes from the Greek lexicos, meaning \"of or for words\". The game design was rejected by game manufacturers such as Parker Brothers and Milton Bradley, but Butts was able to sell copies on his own, though not enough to recoup his development expenses. In 1938, he began work on a board game based on Lexiko, which he called Criss-Cross Words. In 1948, James Brunot, one of the few owners of the original Criss-Cross Words game, bought the rights to manufacture the game. He renamed the game Scrabble, a real word which means \"to scratch or grope around with one\\'s fingers to find, collect, or hold on to something.\" Scrabble\\'s big break came in 1952 when Jack Straus, president of Macy\\'s, played the game on vacation. Upon returning from vacation, he was surprised to find that his store did not carry the game. He placed a large order, and within a year, \"everyone had to have one\".',\n",

The echolocation skills of dolphins far outstrip any technology people have come up with to do the same job. However, these Navy programs have been highly controversial, as animal rights advocates have long opposed the use of dolphins for military purposes. Concerns include the stresses dolphins experience with sudden transportation and transplantation to new areas, muzzles that prevent them from foraging while working, and the risk of accidental detonation of a mine.

In 1861, Benito Juárez—a lawyer and member of the Indigenous Zapotec tribe—was elected president of Mexico. At the time, the country was in financial ruin after years of internal strife, and the new president was forced to default on debt payments to European governments. In response, France, Britain and Spain sent naval forces to Veracruz, Mexico, demanding repayment. Britain and Spain negotiated with Mexico and withdrew their forces. France, however, ruled by Napoleon III, decided to use the opportunity to carve an empire out of Mexican territory. Late in 1861, a well-armed French fleet stormed Veracruz, landing a large force of troops and driving President Juárez and his government into retreat. Certain that success would come swiftly, 6,000 French troops under General Charles Latrille de Lorencez set out to attack Puebla de Los Angeles, a small town in east-central Mexico. From his new headquarters in the north, Juárez rounded up a ragtag force of 2,000 loyal men—many of them either Indigenous Mexicans or of mixed ancestry—and sent them to Puebla. The vastly outnumbered and poorly supplied Mexicans, led by Texas-born General Ignacio Zaragoza, fortified the town and prepared for the French assault. On May 5, 1862, Lorencez gathered his army—supported by heavy artillery—before the city of Puebla and led an assault. The battle lasted from daybreak to early evening, and when the French finally retreated they had lost nearly 500 soldiers. Fewer than 100 Mexicans had been killed in the clash. Although not a major strategic win in the overall war against the French, Zaragoza’s success at the Battle of Puebla on May 5 represented a great symbolic victory for the Mexican government and bolstered the resistance movement. In 1867—thanks in part to military support and political pressure from the United States, which was finally in a position to aid its besieged neighbor after the end of the Civil War—France finally withdrew.',\n",

English merchant marines transported the product for trade to ports around the world, and they became known as “English Walnuts.” England, however, never grew walnuts commercially.

       " 'Some of the earliest coloring books in the United States were produced in Germany and published in Philadelphia by John Weik & Co.\" around 1858. But the real ancestor of the modern coloring book is generally agreed to be British illustrator Kate Greenaway. Born in 1846, Greenaway became internationally recognized as a children’s book illustrator. Sometime in the late 1870s, she teamed up with publisher Cassell Petter & Galpin for The ‘Little Folks’ Painting Book, a reference to a children’s magazine that Cassell Petter & Galpin published. In some cross-promotion, any child who sent in their colored books to a competition the Little Folks magazine was holding could win money and medals, and the books themselves would go to the Children’s Hospitals to \"[provide] for the amusement of little ones during their weary hours in the hospital.\" Several more of these books were published over the following years, some with similar contests.',\n",
       " 'So why were these books so influential? Thank lax copyright laws. American publisher the McLoughlin Brothers took Greenaway’s illustrations and published them in books for the American audience, almost certainly without her permission. These were the books that became massive hits and helped create a new genre.',\n",
       " 'In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, reform movements in children’s education helped to shift popular attitudes about the role of education in achieving social progress. Coloring books became an interactive tool that parents gave to their kids to educate and entertain them, in hopes of giving them an advantage in life. During this time, the cost of books (and paper) also decreased, which made coloring books accessible to more children and families than ever before. Some companies that sold consumer goods, such as shoes and paint, even gave free, promotional coloring books to parents with every purchase.',\n",
       " 'The first adult coloring book mocked corporate culture. Published in 1961 by three advertising executives, The Executive Coloring Book was the first coloring book aimed at adults. Featuring drawings and captions depicting a businessman getting ready for work (\"This is me. I am an executive. Executives are important. They go to important offices and do important things. Color my underwear important.\"), the book satirizes and mocks the monotony, conformity, and austerity inherent in corporate workplaces. After The Executive Coloring Book’s publication, adult coloring books became trendy. Many of these books satirized societal expectations, political extremism, social movements, the Soviet Union, communism, President John F. Kennedy, and mental illness.',\n",
       " \"The 1960s weren't the only time period that cartoonists used adult coloring books to lampoon political figures and promote counterculture or fringe views. More recently, creators of coloring books have used the books to comment on events and figures in contemporary politics. You can find coloring books about the death of Osama bin Laden and the Tea Party (complete with drawings of Sarah Palin and text about the evils of political correctness), as well as coloring books devoted to former President Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, and former President Donald Trump.\",\n",
       " 'According to researchers and art therapists, adults who color in coloring books may experience a variety of therapeutic benefits. Studies in 2005 and 2012 concluded that people who colored in mandalas (complex geometric figures frequently seen in Hinduism and Buddhism) experienced lower levels of anxiety than people who simply colored on a blank piece of paper. By focusing on different shapes and patterns in a structured way, people who color can shut off negative thoughts, becoming calmer. The study concluded that like meditation, the act of coloring patterns can let the brain rest, decrease anxiety, and encourage mindfulness.',\n",

One night Wisner, owner of the Cripple Creek Cow Mountain Gold Mining Company, was staring out the window and thinking about the line of soda waters he was producing for the citizens of Cripple Creek when he came upon an idea. The full moon that night shined on the snow-capped Cow Mountain and reminded him of a scoop of vanilla ice cream. He hurried back to his bar and scooped a spoonful of ice cream into the children’s favorite flavor of soda, Myers Avenue Red Root Beer. After trying, he liked it and served it the very next day. It was an immediate hit. Wisner named the new creation, “Black Cow Mountain” but the local children shortened the name to “Black Cow”, which of course now is widely known as the root beer float.',\n",

This has been disputed by some food historians; they argue that rice pudding likely originated in India, which has an ancient rice culture as well as an ancient sugar culture. In Asia rice pudding was never referred to as rice pudding; instead, it was called a sweet rice porridge. Rice is mixed with water, milk, or cream, and then sweetened to taste before boiling or baking. Sometimes dried fruits are added to the mixture, such as raisins or apricots.',\n",
       " 'The Forme of Cury (1390) – the earliest surviving collection of recipes in England – gives a recipe for a rice pottage, and one for Ryse of Flesh. The Rice of Flesh is savory and made with broth, almond milk and saffron, while the rice pottage is what would become the modern-day rice pudding and the recipe just omits the salt and broth, using water instead to cook the rice the first time. Sugar isn’t added in The Forme of Cury; for a sweetened rice pudding we have to wait until the 15th-century Austin manuscripts, which include a pudding sweetened with honey and sugar. John Murell (A Newe Booke of Cookery) in 1615 adds eggs, suet, currants, cinnamon, sugar and  barberries and stuffs the rice pudding into sausage skins, like a white pudding. In 1660, Robert May (The Accomplisht Cook) adds eggs, beef suet, salt, nutmeg, cloves, mace, currants, dates and powdered coriander seeds. ',\n",

However, the percentage of lefties worldwide is slowly creeping up as being left handed becomes more socially accepted. Believe it or not, to this day some countries still try and force children to learn to write with their right hand!

A flawed 1980s study which looked at 1000 deceased people from California showed that the average age that right-handed subjects died was 75, whereas for lefties it was just 66. The problem here is that the study assumes that the number of left handed people remained static over time. Many people born in the early 1900s were forced to write right-handed, and so would not have identified as being left handed at death. As a result, the findings from this study have been largely discredited. However, there has been some evidence to suggest that left handers are more likely to have minor accidents than their right handed counterparts, so we’re not quite out of the woods!',\n",

Fully mature pandas can be up to six feet long and reach 350 pounds. Pandas are technically carnivores due to their sharp teeth and digestive tracts, but their diets consist nearly exclusively of bamboo. (This is largely because they don’t have the energy to chase anything. Their prey would virtually have to land in their lap, be injured, or too slow to escape.) Pandas eat up to 85 pounds of bamboo a day and can scarf down a shoot in about 40 seconds. But all that fiber has side effects: An adult panda can produce more than 60 pounds of droppings in 24 hours! Eating and sleeping make up most of the panda's day, in fact one reason for pandas being rare is that breeding is not high on their list of priorities. And with only a one-day window a year for a female to conceive naturally, it is hardly surprising that pandas are an endangered species.

At age 16 he was kidnapped by Irish raiders and sold as a slave to a Celtic priest in Northern Ireland. After toiling for six years as a shepherd, he escaped back to Britain. He eventually returned to Ireland as a Christian missionary. Among the legends associated with St. Patrick is that he stood atop an Irish hillside and banished snakes from Ireland—prompting all serpents to slither away into the sea. In fact, research suggests snakes never occupied the Emerald Isle in the first place. There are no signs of snakes in the country’s fossil record. And water has surrounded Ireland since the last glacial period. Before that, the region was covered in ice and would have been too cold for the reptiles.\",\n",

       "  'There are different claims to the origin of the Sloppy Joe.  In Havana, Cuba, in the 1930s, there was a genuine bartender who gained popularity with vacationers who went by the name of Sloppy Joe. He earned his name for his less than enthusiastic way of cleaning the bar.  He was, however, an attentive bartender, and the bar was a hot spot for the jet set. However, no mention is found in papers from the era of a hot sandwich on the menu matching the description of a Sloppy Joe, and the man of the same name retired to Spain in 1933. Town Hall Deli in Maplewood, NJ claims to have a direct connection to Sloppy Joe of Havana fame. It opened in 1927, and during the 1930s, Maplewood’s Mayor Sweeney traveled to Havana, where he met the bartender named Sloppy Joe and was served a delicious sandwich. The mayor came back to New Jersey and with a well-developed taste for Joe’s sandwich. The mayor enjoyed it so much he asked one of Town Hall Deli’s proprietors, Fred Heinz, to replicate it. According to the website, “It was made with coleslaw, ham, cow tongue, swiss cheese, with lots of dressing and was served on thin rye bread. Hence, the origin of the Sloppy Joe sandwich and how Town Hall Deli of South Orange became The Birthplace of the Sloppy Joe!” Then in 1934 at the Ye Olde Tavern Inn, in Sioux City, Iowa, Abraham and Bertha laid claim to the Sloppy Joe when they added a loose meat sandwich on their menu in 1934. Whoever brought the Sloppy Joe to the world, Hunt’s made it more convenient in 1969. They put it in a can and called it Manwich.',\n",

Crushed rice or beans could be used instead of the masa or the tamale could contain no masa at all. Tamales could be wrapped in corn husks, banana leaves, avocado leaves, other non-toxic leaves, or even paper or bark. Tamales were steamed, grilled, roasted, boiled or even fried. There was quite a variety. Tamales of today are more homogeneous.

The origins of pasta alla carbonara are widely debated and there's no clear answer as to where it came from. Some theories state it is an Italian invention while others claim it is an American invention. An interesting theory is that it was invented in WWII when American GIs were stationed in Rome and their rations consisted of eggs and bacon, which was combined with regional pasta to create the dish. This is somewhat unlikely as many chefs will tell you carbonara cannot be made with powdered eggs, which is how the rations were given. Regardless of how it came to be, the general recipe we know today was first published in American and Italian cookbooks around the 1950s. The recipe usually consists of the same 4 ingredients but the proportions are widely debated. First is the pasta, usually spaghetti but it can be anything as long as it has a lot of surface area for sauce to cling to, so you generally want the long noodles. Second is the eggs, often with more yolks than whites to give it that extra rich texture (again, proportions vary widely from recipe to recipe). Next is the cheese, usually pecorino, parmesan, or some combination of these cheeses. Finally is the pancetta (pork belly) or guanciale (pork jowl), which is often substituted with bacon but many will tell you it's not really the same. Purists will also refute the use of cream in the recipe, reasoning that the egg, when prepared properly, should give all the creaminess necessary.

The ingredients necessary for pizza dough — wheat flour, corn oil, salt, and yeast — were not among the rationed foods, and the filling could be made from leftover meats and vegetables. The deep-dish pie was also the perfect meal for manual laborers. Two entrepreneurs were quick to spot the appetite of the boys marching home. Ike Sewell, an ex-University of Texas lineman, and Ric Riccardo, a food business operator of Italian-American heritage, teamed up to open Pizzeria Uno. They sold the first deep-dish pie in 1943. It had a thicker crust than a super-skinny Napoli pie, but not the super-thick crust of a Sicilian one, called Sfincione or Sfinciuni. Rather than being baked on the bottom of the oven, deep-dish was baked in a circular pan, two to three inches deep. The pizza was also upside-down. A thick layer of mozzarella cheese was topped with meat or vegetables, covered with tomato sauce, and topped with crust. The concoction required a knife, a fork, and a napkin — and it was cooked to order. This pizza spawned many other deep-dish pizza places in Chicago over the years, and has ignited much debate over its allure. From Anthony Bourdain to Graham Eliot to Mario Batali, chefs deride the Chicago invention, calling it at worst an abomination and at best unworthy of being called pizza. Foodie comedians have joined in on the oh-so-superior complaint festival. But in the Second City, deep-dish pies are beloved. Native Chicago-ans, like Ike Barinholtz and Shonda Rhimes, have come out swinging.

Shortly before that, processed cheese had been patented by James L. Kraft, an entrepreneur whose revolutionary pasteurizing process ensured that cheese wouldn\\'t spoil, even when transported long distances. By 1914, J.L. Kraft & Bros. Company (the precursor to Kraft Foods) opened its first plant in Illinois; five years later, the company had already expanded into Canada. Of course, this \"factory cheese\" — disparagingly termed \"rattrap cheese\" or \"rat cheese\" by the English who were fiercely proud of their cheddars — was not considered a delicacy. It was, simply, a cheap and scalable product. During World War II, Navy cooks prepared countless \"American cheese filling sandwiches\" — as instructed by government-issued cookbooks — in ships\\' kitchens. In the 1940s and \\'50s, these were usually served open-faced and consisted of one slice of bread topped with grated cheese. In 1949, Kraft Foods introduced Kraft Singles — individually wrapped slices of processed cheese — and supermarkets began stocking them in 1965. Also around that time, the second, perhaps most important, piece of bread was added on top, likely as a way to make the sandwich more filling, and the modern notion of a grilled cheese sandwich was born. It\\'s also worth noting that the actual term \"grilled cheese\" doesn’t make an appearance in print until the 1960s; before that it was always \"toasted cheese” or \"melted cheese\" sandwiches.

       "  'April 13th is the birthday of Alfred Butts, known as the inventor of Scrabble. In 1931, Butts wrote a paper entitled \"Study of Games.\" In his paper, he described three categories of games: board games, number games using playing cards or dice, and letter games (or games that fell into more than one). He noted that, although the most popular games were of the first two (e.g., chess and backgammon), the best letter game readily available was a game called Anagrams. Around that time, he was reading The Gold-Bug by Edgar Allan Poe and noticed a line containing the English letter distribution. This gave him an epiphany: Anagrams would be more fun if the most common letters in English were more common in the game. He carefully analyzed letter frequencies in newspapers such as The New York Times and other printed works to determine the ideal letter distribution for the game. With a few other changes, he named his project Lexiko. The name comes from the Greek lexicos, meaning \"of or for words\". The game design was rejected by game manufacturers such as Parker Brothers and Milton Bradley, but Butts was able to sell copies on his own, though not enough to recoup his development expenses. In 1938, he began work on a board game based on Lexiko, which he called Criss-Cross Words.

Their superior ability to scan an area for particular objects allows them to zero in on mines and drop markers at the spots. The Navy can then find and disarm the mines. The echolocation skills of dolphins far outstrip any technology people have come up with to do the same job. However, these Navy programs have been highly controversial, as animal rights advocates have long opposed the use of dolphins for military purposes. Concerns include the stresses dolphins experience with sudden transportation and transplantation to new areas, muzzles that prevent them from foraging while working, and the risk of accidental detonation of a mine. Though the U.S. Navy Marine Mammal Program maintains that it complies with federal laws regarding the care of their dolphins, activists have continued to fight against exploitation.',\n",

At the time, the country was in financial ruin after years of internal strife, and the new president was forced to default on debt payments to European governments. In response, France, Britain and Spain sent naval forces to Veracruz, Mexico, demanding repayment. Britain and Spain negotiated with Mexico and withdrew their forces. France, however, ruled by Napoleon III, decided to use the opportunity to carve an empire out of Mexican territory. Late in 1861, a well-armed French fleet stormed Veracruz, landing a large force of troops and driving President Juárez and his government into retreat. Certain that success would come swiftly, 6,000 French troops under General Charles Latrille de Lorencez set out to attack Puebla de Los Angeles, a small town in east-central Mexico. From his new headquarters in the north, Juárez rounded up a ragtag force of 2,000 loyal men—many of them either Indigenous Mexicans or of mixed ancestry—and sent them to Puebla. The vastly outnumbered and poorly supplied Mexicans, led by Texas-born General Ignacio Zaragoza, fortified the town and prepared for the French assault. On May 5, 1862, Lorencez gathered his army—supported by heavy artillery—before the city of Puebla and led an assault. The battle lasted from daybreak to early evening, and when the French finally retreated they had lost nearly 500 soldiers. Fewer than 100 Mexicans had been killed in the clash. Although not a major strategic win in the overall war against the French, Zaragoza’s success at the Battle of Puebla on May 5 represented a great symbolic victory for the Mexican government and bolstered the resistance movement. In 1867—thanks in part to military support and political pressure from the United States, which was finally in a position to aid its besieged neighbor after the end of the Civil War—France finally withdrew.',\n",

       "  '--\\tOn average, 12% of the world is left handed, 87% right handed, and 1% ambidextrous. However, the percentage of lefties worldwide is slowly creeping up as being left handed becomes more socially accepted. Believe it or not, to this day some countries still try and force children to learn to write with their right hand! For example, in 1860 when a left handed person was essentially seen as being in league with the devil, it is estimated that as little as 2% of the population was left handed. The current 12% figure also varies by country and gender.',\n",
       "  '--\\tThere have been eight U.S. presidents who were left-handed including: James Garfield, Herbert Hoover, Harry Truman, Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama.',\n",
       "  '--\\tSinister (Latin for left), Mollydooker (Australian slang term), Southpaw (name for a left-handed pitcher), Goofy footed and Cuddy wifter are a few terms for left-handed people.',\n",
       "  '--\\tLeft-handers have typing advantages. On a QWERTY keyboard, they can type over 3,000 English words by solely using the left hand. But only around 300 words can be typed with the right hand alone. ',\n",
       "  '--\\tA study found that right-handers, on average, live to be nine years older than left-handers. This left handed statistic was later disproved – although it is still widespread on the internet! A flawed 1980s study which looked at 1000 deceased people from California showed that the average age that right-handed subjects died was 75, whereas for lefties it was just 66. The problem here is that the study assumes that the number of left handed people remained static over time. Many people born in the early 1900s were forced to write right-handed, and so would not have identified as being left handed at death. As a result, the findings from this study have been largely discredited. However, there has been some evidence to suggest that left handers are more likely to have minor accidents than their right handed counterparts, so we’re not quite out of the woods!',\n",

This stigma began to be tossed out when Christian ministries started to use thrift stores as a way to fund their programs. However, it was not until the 1920s that thrift stores started to look like the ones we have today. The demand for secondhand increased during the Great Depression. During this time, many people could not afford to buy new items. These hard times caused them to seek more secondhand items.',\n",

ThredUp reports that Millenials and Gen Z are adopting shopping for secondhand clothing 2.5 times faster than other generations. The demand for secondhand clothing has only increased throughout the years. From 2017 to 2019, secondhand sales increased by 37 percent in Millennials and 46 percent in Gen Z. These two generations are more likely to buy secondhand because they want to shop more sustainably and ethically.',\n",
       "  '--\\tThrift stores help reduce textile waste. Textile waste is a growing problem around the world. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reports found that 17 million tons of textile waste end up in landfills. This is a problem because textile takes up to 200 or more years to decompose in landfills. One way that textile waste is being reduced is through the help of thrift stores. These kinds of stores collect clothing and resell it. Items that cannot be sold get recycled. This process helps reduce the amount of textile waste that ends up in landfills.',\n",

The fashion industry is the second industry that consumes the most water. Reports state that it consumes an average of 79 billion cubic meters of water per year.

This type of cake is often used as the base of other desserts such as snack cakes, jelly rolls, Swiss rolls and Tres Leches. A basic sponge cake is composed of only four essential ingredients: cake flour, eggs (whole or yolks), granulated sugar, and salt. ',\n",

However, it was not until 1615 when the first sponge cake recipe was recorded by the English poet and author Gervase Markham. Still, the cake was much more like a cookie—thin and crispy.',\n",

       "  'To achieve its characteristic light texture, sponge cake uses whipped eggs. Similar to angel food cake, it relies on the leavening action of air whipped into and trapped by egg protein. The increase in volume is achieved by trapped air and water vapor that expand during baking. Baking powder and/or baking soda are sometimes added to sponge cake formulations to provide additional rise through the production of CO2.
